# Geometric & Graphics Programming Laboratory (IN460)
# Syllabus 2017/2018
### Prof. [Alberto Paoluzzi](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~paoluzzi)


### Course style and Requirements

It was customary in the Rinascimento to send the gifted children 'apprenticed' by masters of art, to better develop their skills. This happened to Leonardo da Vinci who went "to shop" by Verrocchio and Michelangelo by Ghirlandaio.

Programming Laboratory as Rinascimental Workshop :-)

Every week a very small programming task is given at the start of the Friday hours.
Students will develop their solution in class, under supervision and advice of the teacher. The solutions will be loaded on Github at the end of class. No final exams;
no complex project. The grade will be determined by the student's GitHub repository.
